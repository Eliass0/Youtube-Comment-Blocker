# YouTube Comment Blocker
This tool enables you to block comments from specific users across all YouTube comment sections.

## Disclaimer
I developed this tool because I found it personally useful and wanted to share it with others. It's a collaborative effort with AI technology, and I'm happy to share it with the community.

## License
Please note that this is an open-source project. While I've utilized GPT-4 for its development, the code is freely available for use. However, I cannot make any legal claims regarding copyright or guarantees about its functionality.

## Updates
I since stopped the usage of this extention, so I won't be updating it. Feel free to fork it if you want to make changes.

## Platforms
This extension has been tested on a local instance of the Brave browser, but it should work on any Chromium-based browser. It's compatible with manifest version 3.

## Usage
Currently, the tool identifies commenters using their @username. You can input the username (with or without the '@') into the designated field. Instructions are provided within the tool â€“ remember to separate usernames with commas and avoid newlines.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the extensions section in your browser.
3. Activate developer mode.
4. Choose 'Load unpacked extension'.
5. Select the downloaded folder.

## Troubleshooting
Verbose and redundant output can be found in the console.
The default delay is set to 2 seconds, which may need adjustment based on your internet speed.
