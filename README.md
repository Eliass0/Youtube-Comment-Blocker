# Youtube-Comment-Blocker
Allows you to block comments from defined users across all YouTube comment sections.

## Disclaimer
I always wanted this and now with the power of our AI overlord I created it. I don't claim credit, I just share so that other can benefit too.

## License
I don't guarantee shit. I trew this together with GPT4. I also don't really own any of this, so there is no copyright claim to make, I think.
Same goes for security, I didn't check the code. I just checked if it works and it does, if there is anything else. Who knows?

## Updates
If I continue usage of this and the youtube website changes and I have the needed tools I will update the extention probably.

## Plattforms
I tested this on my local instance of the brave browser, but any chromium browser should do. Hey it's even manifest v3.

## Usage
The most important part. At the moment of writing this commenters are identified as such @username. So you just take the username with or without the '@'. I only tested without and put it in the box.
Follow the magic boxes instructions, no newlines and comma seperated. I don't know if this is needed, but I just do what our AI overlord suggest.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Go to extentions in the browser
3. Enable developer mode
4. Load unpacked extention
5. Click on the folder you just downloaded

## Troubleshooting
In the console there is verbose and redundant output.
I hardcoded the delay to 2 seconds, you internet may be slower so you may have to increase that.
